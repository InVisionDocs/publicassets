# File size

Images should be less than 100 KB.

# Fileformat

All images must be a PNG.

All videos must be an MP4.

# Filenames

All visual media must be saved with a descriptive filename that reflects what the media depicts. The filename should not duplicate information in the folder structure. For example, an image saved in the Freehand folder should not include Freehand in its filename.

All filenames must be in camelcase. Camelcase is where the first letter is lowercase, and all subsequent words in the filename are uppercase. Here is an example: camelCaseExample. Camelcase helps with readability of filenames.
